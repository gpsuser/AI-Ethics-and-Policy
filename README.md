This document expands on the framework developed by Ryan Mioduski <https://github.com/ryanmio/AI-Ethics-and-Policy>.

The intention is to introduce a wider scope,  beyond generateive AI - and along the way acknowledging the role that data plays in the development and deployment of responsible AI systems.

In particular, the ethical development and deployment of AI systems starts with the ethical sourcing, curation and governance of the data (and related data pipelines) used to test, calibrate and productionalise AI systems. This is a critical aspect of AI ethics that is often overlooked.

This document is a work in progress and is intended to be a living document that will be updated as the field of AI ethics and policy evolves.
